## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* The purpose of this analysis is to use various machine learning techniques to train and evaluate a transgression model in determining the accuracy for healthy and high risk loans.
* The lending data provided includes the following: loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt to income ratio, number of accounts, derrogatory marks, total debt and loan status.
* The general goal was to predict if a loan is healthy or high-risk.
* The target variable `y` is the `loan_status` which can be classified as 0 or 1 and our main focal point of predictive analysis. The healthy loan is represented by 0 while the high-risk loan is represented by 1.
* Stages of the Machine Learning Process includes the following:
  I. Data Collection and Preparation
  II. Model Preference
  III. Model Training
  IV. Model Prediction
  V. Model Utilization
* The Logistic Regression Model with the `random_oversampler` model was used to determine credit risk classification accuracy. The model's performance was evaluated based on the accuracy score.

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
